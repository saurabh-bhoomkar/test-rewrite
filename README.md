To store multiple X.509 certificates in DER format in a single file, you can convert each individual certificate into DER format and then concatenate them into one file.

However, note that **DER format** (Distinguished Encoding Rules) typically stores a **single certificate**. There's no standard for bundling multiple certificates into one single DER file. But, you could still combine them into a single file (non-standard) by following these steps:

### Here's a way to do this:

1. **Split the Certificates** (If they're in PEM format):
   If your certificates are currently in PEM format (text-based, `BEGIN CERTIFICATE...`), you'll need to first split them into individual files.

   Use the following command to split the PEM certificates (similar to before):

   ```bash
   awk 'BEGIN {c=0;} /-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/ {c++} {print > "cert" c ".pem"} /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ {close("cert" c ".pem")}' your_file.pem
   ```

   This will create multiple files, e.g., `cert1.pem`, `cert2.pem`, etc.

2. **Convert Each PEM Certificate to DER Format**:
   After splitting the certificates, you can convert each PEM file to DER format using `openssl`:

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -in cert1.pem -outform der -out cert1.der
   openssl x509 -in cert2.pem -outform der -out cert2.der
   # Repeat for each certificate...
   ```

3. **Concatenate the DER Files**:
   Once you have each certificate in DER format, you can concatenate them into one file:

   ```bash
   cat cert1.der cert2.der cert3.der > allcerts.der
   ```

This will create a single file `allcerts.der` that contains multiple certificates in binary DER format. However, **it's non-standard** to bundle multiple DER certificates in one file like this, and many tools may not expect this format.

### Alternative: PKCS7/PKCS12 Format
If you need a standard file that contains multiple certificates, itâ€™s better to use the **PKCS#7** or **PKCS#12** format, which is specifically designed for bundling multiple certificates.

#### Using PKCS#7 (for bundling multiple certificates):
1. Convert the PEM certificates to PKCS#7 format:

   ```bash
   openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile your_file.pem -outform der -out bundle.p7b
   ```

   The `bundle.p7b` file will be in DER format and can hold multiple certificates.

#### Using PKCS#12 (for bundling certificates and keys):
If you also need to include private keys, you can use PKCS#12 (`.p12` or `.pfx`):

1. Convert the certificates to PKCS#12 format (including private key):

   ```bash
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out bundle.p12 -in certfile.pem -inkey private_key.pem
   ```
